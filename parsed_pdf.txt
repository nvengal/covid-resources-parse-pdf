Westerville City Schools
Free Breakfast and Lunch
Service Description: Beginning Thursday, March 19h, and every weekday through at least Friday, April 3 , several of
our buses and vans will make 75 stops around the district to deliver food to children who are 18 years of age and
younger. Each of these stops will be for a designated window of time, with all stops being completed between the hours
of 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. Huber Ridge Elementary School will also serve as a walk-up site for meals between 11 a.m.
and 2 p.m. each weekday.
rd
This delivery plan was developed according to USDA regulations. Unfortunately, according to USDA rules, children will
not be able to bring food back for their siblings, so every child who wants a meal must be present at the designated
delivery location. Children will receive a lunch for the day, and a breakfast meal for the next morning. We will have
additional vehicles on standby to deliver more meals at a moment's notice in case a location runs out of food and there
are children who have not yet received their meals. Any leftover food from these routes will be taken back to Huber Ridge
Elementary School for distribution.
Parents are encouraged to watch their email tomorrow as the Transportation Department will be sending out additional
details regarding the times and locations of designated delivery stops. Lastly, we have been in contact with other
community organizations, such as the Westerville Area Resource Ministry (WARM), that also are working to make meals
available to families. Please continue to watch for information from these valued partners in this effort.
